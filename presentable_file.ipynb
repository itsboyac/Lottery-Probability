    "1. Factorial\n",
    "* What it is: The factorial of a non-negative integer $n$, denoted by $n!$, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to $n$. $$n! = n \\times (n-1) \\times \\dots \\times 2 \\times 1$$\n",
    "* Why it's used (Permutations): It calculates the total number of unique ways to order $n$ distinct items. This concept is called a permutation. For example, the number of ways to arrange 4 books on a shelf is $4! = 24$.\n",

    "2. Combinations  ($\\binom{n}{k}$ or $C(n, k)$)\n",
    "* What it is: Combinations calculate the number of ways to choose a subset of $k$ items from a larger set of $n$ distinct items, where the order of selection is irrelevant.$$\\binom{n}{k} = \\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$\n",
    "* Why it's used (Counting Subsets): It addresses questions like: \"If I have 10 people, how many different groups of 3 can I form?\" The group {A, B, C} is the same as {C, B, A}, which is why we divide out the permutations (using the factorials in the denominator).\n",

    "3. Calculating Probability\n",
    "$$P(E) = \\frac{\\text{Number of Favorable Outcomes}}{\\text{Total Number of Possible Outcomes}}$$\n",
    "* Total Possible Outcomes: Your combination function is used to calculate the size of the sample space—the denominator in the probability equation. For example, the total number of ways to choose 5 cards from a 52-card deck is $\\binom{52}{5}$.\n",
    "* Favorable Outcomes: Your combination function (and sometimes factorials, depending on the problem) is used to calculate the size of the event space—the numerator. For example, the number of ways to choose 5 red cards from the 26 available red cards is $\\binom{26}{5}$.\n",
